# Reference evapotranspiration - AgERA5 derived (Global - Daily - ~10km)

## Short description
Reference evapotranspiration per day with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree. Unit: mm day-1. The dataset contains daily values for global land areas, excluding Antarctica, since 1979. The dataset has been prepared according to the FAO Penman - Monteith method as described in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56.

## Provenance

ETo's input variables are part of the Agrometeorological indicators dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) through the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).

The Agrometeorological indicators dataset provides daily surface meteorological data for the period from 1979 to present as input for agriculture and agro-ecological studies. This dataset is based on the hourly ECMWF ERA5 data at surface level and is referred to as AgERA5. References: https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.6c68c9bb
