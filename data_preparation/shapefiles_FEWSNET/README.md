# FEWS NET Crop Statistics Unit Dataset

## Short description
The FEWS NET crop statistics unit dataset contains a unique geocode (FNID) of an administrative unit that is linked to the country's boundary at a given point in time. FEWS NET has tracked changes in the names and geometry of administrative boundaries and created a [database](https://fews.net/data/geographic-boundaries) of historical and current subnational administrative boundaries for a number of countries. The FNID is represented as `adm_id` and is aligned with the `adm_id` of the crop statistics dataset.
