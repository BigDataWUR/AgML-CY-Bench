# Multiyear Maize Management Dataset collected in Chiapas, Mexico
The dataset  consists of a single table integrated by 4 main types of variables: identification of field, maize yield and field management, soil characteristics, and weather conditions during the season. Each of the 4585 rows in the table corresponds to a unique field for the corresponding season.
