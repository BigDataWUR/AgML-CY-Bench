# GISCO statistical unit dataset

## Short description
The GISCO statistical unit dataset represents the NUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) and Statistical regions by means of multipart polygon, polyline and point topology. The NUTS geographical information is completed by attribute tables and a set of cartographic help lines to better visualize multipart polygonal regions.

The NUTS are a hierarchical system divided into 3 levels. NUTS 1: major socio-economic regions, NUTS 2: basic regions for the application of regional policies, NUTS 3: small regions for specific diagnoses. Additionally a NUTS 0 level, usually co-incident with national boundaries are also available.
