# Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpement des Textiles (CMDT) Monitoring Operational Maize Yield Statistics

## Short description
The data derived comes from CMDT Monitoring Operational - a Malian Company for the Development of Textiles located in Southern Mali. It consists of 5 CMDT regions and 28 CMDT sectors. It provides key observations from the maize yield data for the different zones/regions and sectors from 1990 to 2017. There is significant spatial and temporal variation in maize productivity in the region, likely driven by differences in agro-climatic conditions, management practices, and potential data limitations.
