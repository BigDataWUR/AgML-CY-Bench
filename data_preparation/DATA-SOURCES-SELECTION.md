## Remote sensing indicators
In view of an operational deployment of the sub-national yield forecasting, we selected two operational products representing crop biomass and health: FPAR and NDVI.
FPAR (Fraction of Adsorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) dekadal (10-day) and 500 m spatial resolution gap-filled and smoothed MODIS and VIIRS FPAR data is sourced from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/data/indicators_fpar/.

## Soil
We selected data from the [WISE project][global_soil_WISE/README.md] for soil properties. Another choice is [SoilGrids](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids).

WISE soil data is a better choice than SoilGrids for the following reasons:
* agronomic interpretation is easier for WISE compared to SoilGrids.
* SoilGrids did not provide soil rootable depth and water holding capacity (this may have changed recently)
* WISE is based on soil maps whose properties are estimated by expert knowledge collected over the years. For example, in the Netherlands, we see that the performance of [BOFEK](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116123) (similar to WISE) is still considerably better than SoilGrids.

## Crop masks
We sourced crop-type specific (maize and winter-spring cereals) high spatial resolution (10 m) maps from ESA WorldCereal (https://esa-worldcereal.org/en). Area Fraction images fully spatially compatible with the JRC FPAR 500 m were derived from the rofinal WorldCereal maps.
