## Soil
We selected data from the [WISE project][global_soil_WISE/README.md] for soil properties. Another choice is [SoilGrids](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids).

WISE soil data is a better choice than SoilGrids for the following reasons:
* agronomic interpretation is easier for WISE compared to SoilGrids.
* SoilGrids did not provide soil rootable depth and water holding capacity (this may have changed recently)
* WISE is based on soil maps whose properties are estimated by expert knowledge collected over the years. For example, in the Netherlands, we see that the performance of [BOFEK](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116123) (similar to WISE) is still considerably better than SoilGrids.

| [WorldCereal](https://github.com/ucg-uv/research_products/tree/main/cropcalendars) - Selected for benchmark because rainfed and irrigated are aggregated making it consistent with the yield data | Merging of different sources, raster maps for wheat and maize (res 0.5Â°).

Few windows per country, mostly determined by the number of rainfall seasons. | Planting and harvesting. | Global cover but the planting and harvesting dates have to be manually approximated. Useful for general information purposes only. | Y |
